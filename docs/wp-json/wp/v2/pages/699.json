In many situations, there is only partial information about the context of the experiments, the agent&#8217;s preferences, or the consequences of certain decisions. Under these settings, classical Decision Theory is insufficient, and the introduction of imprecise probabilities is required to properly formulate a decision framework that is perhaps more realistic. The resulting models aim at extending the optimal decision criteria, robustifying them with respect to such uncertainties, and accommodating them for preference tuning and expert information aggregation.<\/mark><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nicol\u00e1s Carrizosa received the BSc degree in Mathematics from the University of Oviedo and the MSc in Statistics for Data Science from the University Carlos III de Madrid.
