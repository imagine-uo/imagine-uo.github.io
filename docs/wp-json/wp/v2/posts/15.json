This paper was done by Enrique Miranda and Ignacio Montes in collaboration with Andr\u00e9s Presa, a young mathematician and physicist who is currently taking a master course on astrophysics in the Leiden University (The Netherlands). This paper was part of his final Bachellor&#8217;s project on mathematics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this paper we formalise the notion of inner approximation of a coherent lower probability, which is a another coherent lower probability whose credal set is more precise. Hence, we go in the opposite direction than in our previous papers about outer approximations. The paper is structured as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>After detailing some preliminary concepts and notation in Section 2, in Section 3 we formalise the notion of inner approximation and we show how to compute optimal 2- or complete-monotone inner approximations by solving (linear or quadratic) opmisation problems. We also detail the similarities and differences between inner and outer approximations.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>In Section 4 we analyse the problem of inner approximating a coherent lower probability by a distortion model such as the linear vacuous, pari mutuel or total variation models. Somehow surprising, we show that the problem of finding an optimal inner approximation in these families is equivalent to the problem of finding the centroid of a credal set.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>In Section 5 we explain the common setting of a decision making problem under uncertainty and we show how inner and outer approximations can be used to simplify the computation and how they behave for the common criteria in the IP literature (gamma-maximin and maximax, maximality, interval dominance and E-admissibility).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Finally, in Section 6 we illustrate how to apply the results in Section 5 in an example.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to take a look at the paper, you can find it <a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10479-023-05577-y\">here<\/a>, in the AOR website, where it available as open access.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have published a new paper entitled \u00abInner approximations of coherent lower probabilities and their application to decision making problems\u00bb.
