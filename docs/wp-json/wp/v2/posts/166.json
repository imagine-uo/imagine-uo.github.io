Traditionally, the field has focused on aggregation functions as tools for combining degrees of truth or membership values, typically defined within the unit interval. Consequently, much of the developed theory has concentrated on functions over this unit interval or, more generally, over closed and bounded real intervals. In recent decades, however, researchers across a wide range of disciplines have extended aggregation processes to richer and more complex structures. A non-exhaustive list of examples is the following: compositional data in geochemistry, directional data in biology, functional data in functional data analysis, image data in computer vision, multivariate data in statistics, ranking data in social choice theory, and string data in computer science.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Nieto-Barba<\/strong> and <strong>Ignacio Montes<\/strong> are organising a special session on Imprecise Probabilities:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Theorical and applied aspects of Imprecise Probabilities<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This session is dedicated to papers that either present significant advances in the foundations of Imprecise Probabilities or demonstrate potential real-world applications of these methods. Papers exploring the connections between imprecise probabilities and other fields, such as fuzzy sets or game theory, are also welcome, as well as those related to possibility measures or Dempster-Shafer Evidence theory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope these special sessions will attract the attention of researchers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The IMPU 2026 conference: International Conference on Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems 2026 will take place from June 15 to 19, 2026, in Rome, Italy.
