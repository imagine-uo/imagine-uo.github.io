The main topic of the session was aggregation theory, with a special focus on extending aggregation methods beyond the classical approaches to richer data structures such as compositional, directional, functional, image, multivariate, ranking and string data.\u00a0 11 authors presented their works in this special session, which was divided in two sessions.<\/mark><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-black-color\">In addition to organizing a special session, R\u00e1ul P\u00e9rez-Fern\u00e1ndez presented his work <em>\u201cAn Axiomatic Study of the Properties Satisfied by Methods for Ranking Elements of a Poset\u201d<\/em>, in collaboration with Ignacio Montes and Bernard De Baets.\u00a0During his presentation, he discussed some axiomatic properties that a method for aggregating elements in a poset may satisfy and analyzed which of these properties are satisfied by some common methods used for this purpose.\u00a0Marina Iturrate-Bobes also presented her work <em>\u201cGoodness-of-Fit tests to Location-Scale Families Based on OWA functions\u201d<\/em> (in colaboration with Ignacio Montes and Ra\u00fal P\u00e9rez-Fern\u00e1ndez). During her talk, she introduced a family of skewness coefficients based on OWA functions (more specifically, on a linear combination of quantiles). She presented its main properties as well as its sample version and asymptotic distribution.\u00a0 These coefficients were later applied to goodness-of-fit tests to location-scale families. Furthermore, she was awarded with an EUSFLAT student grant to attend the conference.\u00a0<\/mark><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\"><div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"3611\" height=\"5417\" src=\"http:\/\/imagine.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/EUSFLAT-2025-Presentacion-Raul.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-828\" style=\"width:auto;height:300px\"\/><\/figure><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\"><div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"3648\" height=\"5472\" src=\"http:\/\/imagine.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/EUSFLAT-2025-Presentacion-Marina.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-827\" style=\"width:auto;height:300px\"\/><\/figure><\/div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-black-color\">It must be remarked that Ra\u00fal P\u00e9rez-Fern\u00e1ndez was a coauthor of another work: <em>\u201cConstruction of Uninorms on Bounded Lattices: Augmenting the flexibility of Choice\u201d<\/em>, done in collaboration with Ander Go\u00f1i-Medrano and Marisol G\u00f3mez-Fern\u00e1ndez, from the Public University of Navarra and the Navarra Artificial Intelligence Research Center (NAIR Center).<\/mark><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-black-color\">The conference was a highly enriching and interesting event, with excellent organization throughout.
