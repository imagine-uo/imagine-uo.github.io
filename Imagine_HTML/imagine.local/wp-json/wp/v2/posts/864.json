The programme of this event consisted in 4 keynote talks and 8 non-parallel sessions, each of which was divided in two parts. In the first part, the researchers gave a short presentation (either 4 or 9 minutes) about their works, whereas in the second one, there was one-hour poster session dedicated to discussing the topic. <strong>David Nieto-Barba<\/strong>, <strong>Enrique Miranda<\/strong> and <strong>Marina Iturrate-Bobes<\/strong> attended this conference.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"http:\/\/imagine.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/ISIPTA-2025-Quique-David-y-Marina.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-869\" style=\"width:auto;height:250px\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>David Nieto-Barba presented his work entitled <em>\u201cDistorting lower probabilities using common distortion models\u201d<\/em> done in collaboration with Ignacio Montes and Enrique Miranda on 15 July. He discussed the generalisation of several prominent distortion models to the case of an initially imprecise model. More concretely, imprecise extensions of the Vertical Barrier Models (which include the Linear Vacuous and Pari-Mutuel Model, as well as the Total Variation Model) were introduced; and a number of desirable properties were analysed in this context, for the purpose of enhancing robustness of already imprecise models&nbsp; His poster was awarded with the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> Price Poster Award.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\"><div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"3259\" height=\"2444\" src=\"http:\/\/imagine.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/ISIPTA-2025-Presentacion-David.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-866\" style=\"width:auto;height:250px\"\/><\/figure><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\"><div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"2048\" height=\"923\" src=\"http:\/\/imagine.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/ISIPTA-2025-Premio-poster-David.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-867\" style=\"object-fit:cover;width:300px;height:250px\"\/><\/figure><\/div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Enrique Miranda\u2019s work (in collaboration with Ignacio Montes) was entitled <em>\u201cOn the closure of aggregation rules for imprecise probabilities\u201d<\/em>. He gave his presentation on 15 July, in which he discussed the problem of aggregating several imprecise probability models using different aggregation rules, investigating whether the aggregation rules are closed in the sense that the aggregated model belongs to the same family as the inputs. Moreover, he was elected as the <a href=\"https:\/\/sipta.org\/\">President of the Society for Imprecise Probabilities<\/a> for the period 2025-2027.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" src=\"http:\/\/imagine.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/ISIPTA-2025-Presentacion-Quique.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-865\" style=\"width:auto;height:250px\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>On 17 July, Marina Iturrate-Bobes presented her work <em>\u201cHow do normality tests behave for rounded data?\u201d<\/em> in collaboration with Ignacio Montes and Ra\u00fal P\u00e9rez-Fern\u00e1ndez. In this contribution, she tackled this topic from the perspective of random sets, which were used as a model to explain how the most extended normality tests (Anderson-Darling, Lilliefors and Shapiro -Wilk) are affected when the data is rounded. For this purpose, she explored the power of the three tests and their respective acceptance, indecision and rejection regions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"2559\" src=\"http:\/\/imagine.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/ISIPTA-2025-Poster-Marina.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-868\" style=\"width:auto;height:300px\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>This conference format provided participants with the opportunity to hold discussions and exchange ideas. The poster discussion sessions of David, Enrique and Marina were all well attended, which allowed them to have quite interesting discussions with other researchers. Furthermore, the well-organized social program was also enriching.
