<p>Held right by the Alhambra between the 19th and 23rd of October, the <a href="https://www.bfasociety.org/BFTA2025/index.html">7th School on Belief Functions and their Applications</a> was hosted at Carmen de la Victoria, Universidad de Granada, Granada (Spain). Chaired by Serafin Moral on behalf of the Belief Functions and Applications Society (BFAS), the school consisted of 11 lectures aimied at introducing belief functions and presenting their main research and applicability areas. Enrique Miranda gave a conference on <em>“Imprecise Probabilities Interpretation of Belief Functions”</em> in which he discussed belief functions as a particular model of imprecise probabilities and explained the different interpretations of the probability models. Additionally, Inés Couso talked about <em>‘Random Sets and Random Fuzzy Sets’</em>.</p>

<p>The IMPU 2026 conference:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>International Conference on Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems 2026</em></p>



<p>will take place from June 15 to 19, 2026, in Rome, Italy. Relevant information about the conference can be found on the IPMU 2026 <a href="https://www.sbai.uniroma1.it/conferenze/ipmu2026/index.php">website</a>. As in previous editions, the members of IMAGINE are organising two special sessions.</p>



<p>Bernard de Baets and <strong>Raúl Pérez-Fernández</strong> are organising a special session about aggregation:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Aggregation theory in non-traditional contexts</em></p>



<p>This session is dedicated to aggregation theory, which has become a central branch of fuzzy set theory. Traditionally, the field has focused on aggregation functions as tools for combining degrees of truth or membership values, typically defined within the unit interval. Consequently, much of the developed theory has concentrated on functions over this unit interval or, more generally, over closed and bounded real intervals. In recent decades, however, researchers across a wide range of disciplines have extended aggregation processes to richer and more complex structures. A non-exhaustive list of examples is the following: compositional data in geochemistry, directional data in biology, functional data in functional data analysis, image data in computer vision, multivariate data in statistics, ranking data in social choice theory, and string data in computer science.</p>



<p><strong>David Nieto-Barba</strong> and <strong>Ignacio Montes</strong> are organising a special session on Imprecise Probabilities:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Theorical and applied aspects of Imprecise Probabilities</em></p>



<p>This session is dedicated to papers that either present significant advances in the foundations of Imprecise Probabilities or demonstrate potential real-world applications of these methods. Papers exploring the connections between imprecise probabilities and other fields, such as fuzzy sets or game theory, are also welcome, as well as those related to possibility measures or Dempster-Shafer Evidence theory.</p>



<p>We hope these special sessions will attract the attention of researchers.</p>

<p>The 14th International Symposium on Imprecise Probabilities: Theories and Applications, <a href="https://isipta25.sipta.org/">ISIPTA 2025</a>, took place in Bielefeld University (Bielefeld, Germany) on 15-18 July 2025. The programme of this event consisted in 4 keynote talks and 8 non-parallel sessions, each of which was divided in two parts. In the first part, the researchers gave a short presentation (either 4 or 9 minutes) about their works, whereas in the second one, there was one-hour poster session dedicated to discussing the topic. <strong>David Nieto-Barba</strong>, <strong>Enrique Miranda</strong> and <strong>Marina Iturrate-Bobes</strong> attended this conference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>David Nieto-Barba presented his work entitled <em>“Distorting lower probabilities using common distortion models”</em> done in collaboration with Ignacio Montes and Enrique Miranda on 15 July. He discussed the generalisation of several prominent distortion models to the case of an initially imprecise model. More concretely, imprecise extensions of the Vertical Barrier Models (which include the Linear Vacuous and Pari-Mutuel Model, as well as the Total Variation Model) were introduced; and a number of desirable properties were analysed in this context, for the purpose of enhancing robustness of already imprecise models&nbsp; His poster was awarded with the 3<sup>rd</sup> Price Poster Award.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Enrique Miranda’s work (in collaboration with Ignacio Montes) was entitled <em>“On the closure of aggregation rules for imprecise probabilities”</em>. He gave his presentation on 15 July, in which he discussed the problem of aggregating several imprecise probability models using different aggregation rules, investigating whether the aggregation rules are closed in the sense that the aggregated model belongs to the same family as the inputs. Moreover, he was elected as the <a href="https://sipta.org/">President of the Society for Imprecise Probabilities</a> for the period 2025-2027.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On 17 July, Marina Iturrate-Bobes presented her work <em>“How do normality tests behave for rounded data?”</em> in collaboration with Ignacio Montes and Raúl Pérez-Fernández. In this contribution, she tackled this topic from the perspective of random sets, which were used as a model to explain how the most extended normality tests (Anderson-Darling, Lilliefors and Shapiro -Wilk) are affected when the data is rounded. For this purpose, she explored the power of the three tests and their respective acceptance, indecision and rejection regions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This conference format provided participants with the opportunity to hold discussions and exchange ideas. The poster discussion sessions of David, Enrique and Marina were all well attended, which allowed them to have quite interesting discussions with other researchers. Furthermore, the well-organized social program was also enriching. From here, we extend our gratitude to the organizers and look forward to participating in the next ISIPTA Conference.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-black-color">The Total Variation Distance for Comparing Non-Additive Measures</mark></em></p>



<p><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-black-color">has been accepted for publication in the International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems. </mark></p>



<p><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-black-color">This paper, written by David Nieto-Barba, Enrique Miranda and Ignacio Montes, explores the comparison of non-additive probabilities, with the Total Variation distance between probability measures as baseline. The first proposal extends this distance  by taking the minimum Total Variation distance among the pairs of probability measures dominating the respective non-additive measures, while the second one replaces the minimum by a maximum. In our last approach, we consider the minimum of the supremum distances instead.</mark></p>



<p><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-black-color">The preliminary Section 2 is followed by the analysis of each of these approaches in the respective Sections 3, 4 and 5. More concretely, for each proposal we investigate the distance-like properties fulfilled, computational simplifications in terms of the boundary or the extreme points of the set of dominating probabilities, alternative expressions in terms of the values of the non-additive measures and their application to the distortion of non additive measures.</mark></p>



<p><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-black-color">In doing so, we demonstrate that neither of the extensions considered is a distance and, while the computation of the first a third approaches reduces to the boundary of the sets of dominating probabilities, the third one may be simply computed in terms of the extreme points. Moreover, we find sufficent conditions allowing us to express the minimum and maximum Total Variation distances and subsequent distortions directly in terms of the values of the non-additive measures.</mark></p>



<p><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-black-color">To conclude, the Section 7 proves the connection of the distortions by the minimum distances proposals with the strong and weak cores in coalition game theory.</mark></p>

<p><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-black-color">Raúl Pérez-Fernández was in charge of organizing the special session <em>“New contexts in Aggregation Theory”</em>, in collaboration with Bernard De Baets from Ghent University. The main topic of the session was aggregation theory, with a special focus on extending aggregation methods beyond the classical approaches to richer data structures such as compositional, directional, functional, image, multivariate, ranking and string data.  11 authors presented their works in this special session, which was divided in two sessions.</mark></p>



<p><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-black-color">In addition to organizing a special session, Rául Pérez-Fernández presented his work <em>“An Axiomatic Study of the Properties Satisfied by Methods for Ranking Elements of a Poset”</em>, in collaboration with Ignacio Montes and Bernard De Baets. During his presentation, he discussed some axiomatic properties that a method for aggregating elements in a poset may satisfy and analyzed which of these properties are satisfied by some common methods used for this purpose. Marina Iturrate-Bobes also presented her work <em>“Goodness-of-Fit tests to Location-Scale Families Based on OWA functions”</em> (in colaboration with Ignacio Montes and Raúl Pérez-Fernández). During her talk, she introduced a family of skewness coefficients based on OWA functions (more specifically, on a linear combination of quantiles). She presented its main properties as well as its sample version and asymptotic distribution.  These coefficients were later applied to goodness-of-fit tests to location-scale families. Furthermore, she was awarded with an EUSFLAT student grant to attend the conference. </mark></p>
